Finally, got chance to go abroad outside Indonesia. This is my first journey, to Hongkong. We will be here in 4 days, 2 days training, and 2 days for having fun, he he he. Start from subuh at 04.00 AM to the airport. After clearing customs, we proceed to our plane. We ride China Airlines. As you might guess, all languages, writings, newspapers were in chinese. Dunno, maybe my face looks like a chinese guy. Everytime the stewardess served us, they always said Xiexie to me, but to my friend next to me, they said Thankyou :)).

There, we stay at ChaterHouse hotel. Small and warm place. It's weird in hongkong that all building were Ruko, so the first floor used for Shop/Store, and the next floor will be their homeplace as apartment.

Oya, We spent first day with visiting police station. My friend seems to have problem with his passport, so we go to police station and ask for a memo to gave to Immigration office. But finally, in night, somebody from airport called us, he has the passport, thank god :)

That's all, training start...
:)

tobe continued..
