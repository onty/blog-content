Ok, since mommy wants daddy to continue this post, here comes daddy...

We enter the most important part in our life. It's 14 March 2006, we
held a simple but religious Akad Nikah ceremony that took place on
mommy's family house at Bukittinggi. Actually we planned to held that on
the nearest Mosque around, but it's already late night ( Isya' time was
around 8.00 PM at Bukittinggi ) so our parents decided to held the
ceremony just at home.

Don't ask me how nervous I was that time. My hand was so cold and sweat.
My throat also feels bad until I ask Bulek Sur for a glass of water.
Grandpa was also very nervous, his mouth indicating that he praise
Allah's name. Seeing him only made me more nervous :D

And, here comes the Akad Nikah, I grab Grandpa Parjono's hand tightly,
and first try was not too good. I'm too nervous for this religious
ceremony. So Grandpa Soenarto ask me to repeat the process.  And at the
second time, I finally spoke the whole Akad Nikah words perfectly.

The second part was my Mas Kawin, which is "hafalan" from a whole surah
of Al-Mulk. Here's the picture :

After that, the whole process was completely done. We all can smile out,
alhamdulillah. Finally, we became husband and wife :)

We all take a rest then, and prepare for the big day tomorrow for our
wedding party at Dymens Hotel in Bukittinggi. We will post that on part
III :) A day full of smiling, and hand shaking ....
