Hongkong is a nice city. I love the mass transportation railway,it's so clean, and of course, definitely fast. Everything is well organized here. I rarely seen any traffic jam in here although the street is not as wide as in Indonesia. Public transportation leave and arrive in time. In this case, who needs private vehicle ?

The training was great too. I have a lot question about tuning that answered here, especially in jvm tuning.

Btw, you can see my photo here :
