Dear Blog,

It's been a long time since I left his blog static without any update.
This time I want to share Achi's picture, here's one of them.

Yes, she's busy calling someone by phone :)  Achi is currently 1 year
and 6 months now. She can walk and sometimes saying a rave words. Three
words that she able to pronounce it clearly are "Yyah" (means Ayah),
"Mammamma" (means Mama) and "Cak" (means Cicak). She loves to observe
new things, especially when a cat walk into our house.

Ya Allah, I'm truly grateful to all what You gave us, Alhamdulillah. I
hope Achi always gets everything the best on her life.
