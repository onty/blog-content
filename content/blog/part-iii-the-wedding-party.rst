Been so long for next post, little busy with jobs (since when did a
programmer hasnt busy in their life ? :p).
Back on part III, here's the tale of our marriage day in Bukittinggi,
placed on Dymens Hotel. The wedding party started
at 10.00 AM, ended at 10.00 PM, he he, what a long long day for both of
us. It feels weird that time, wearing a javanese clothes, with keris on
my back. And not to mention the blankon I wear. I look like one of
srimulat player :D We changed our clothes 3 times. The first blue one,
traditional clothes from javanese. Here's the picture :

The third one, we dont have the picture, it's a brown coloured
traditional javanese clothes. Well, 3 times change for 12 hourse
wedding, that sounds enough :D So, interested to contract us as your
wedding model ? ;)

There are a lots of traditional javanese ceremony during our wedding.
And alhamdulillah, we can select the one whose not against Islamic
syariah. For example, "sungkeman" ceremony. This ceremony presents our
thanks, and our loyalty to our parents for growing us until we can
married.

Eyang Prihartini cant hold her tears when the ceremony began. Oh God,
please bless our parents, forgive their sin, and bring them to the best
place near you, Amin.

Ok that's the end of part III.
