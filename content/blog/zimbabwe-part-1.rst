Chance to see the outside world is one of my reason to take this job :).
Never ever crossed in my mind before that I will visit this country. I
have heard about this country before  when economic crisis hit this
country around 2008.  1 trillion dollar zimbabwe equals to 1 USD, such
an epic story. My impression first time I hit this country is that, it
looks like Indonesia, on 1970's :) ( don't get me wrong, I see 1970's
picture of Indonesia in some old movie, I wasn't born yet that day :p ).
If you see the buses, the people, and how the city looks like, then you
might end up with the same conclusion with me :D.

No pic hoax ? Here's one of the picture I took during my journey from
hotel to /// office. Unfortunately I don't have the picture for the old
buses (updated), but you can imagine inter-city bus, with full of bag
loaded on top of it. Yeah, one of the problem here is transportation.
Those buses seem to only pass once in a few hour. Once they passed,
there will be so many people waiting, together with their belongings. I
also see some people waive their hands on the streets looking for a car
lift. Not sure if it is safe to give them a lift, since I'm just a
foreigner here.

Here's the bus view in Harare..

But wait, there's also tall building here in this country :). During my
first week here, /// put me on Crowne plaza hotel located on the city
centre, surrounded by few tall buildings.

See ? Not too bad, except the internet speed :D. I can only really
browse the internet on 5-6 AM in the morning. When I came back to hotel
from the office around 7-8, the internet speed is horrible. I waited so
long to open a webpage ( which then ended up with me closing the laptop
and go to sleep :p). Yeah, the infrastructure is not good here.
Telecommunications and Transportation, those 2 things need to be
improved first here before they want to go to the next step.

--- Updated, here's the other city view of Harare..

Now, the good thing about this country is that, there's almost no
traffic jam :). We can go to the airport from /// office in about 30
minutes on daytime.

road with less cars, compare this to Jakarta :). And yes, I rarely seen
any motor bikes here, which is probably a good thing :D.

And the other good thing, Indonesia has its embassy here. So, I went
there to meet with the people and to introduce myself. It's good to have
Indonesian friends in this nowhere country :D, at least I can speak
bahasa again after so long. Feels like home, but not the real home :).
The embassy staff are very helpful, if you imagine that all government
officers are hard, rigid, then you are wrong. They are all very friendly
here. I went there almost every weekend, just to say hi, and to talk to
them.  And yes, they held a friendly 17an match to celebrate Indonesia's
independence day, where  I won Gaple match, with pak Tachsin Fernandi as
my co-player....:)

16.19.29| <https://theprasojos.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2014-06-21-16-19-29.jpg>`_\ There's
only about 40 Indonesian people here in Zimbabwe, including the kids.
Not so much, but that makes them big family together in a foreign
country :) If you are interested more, just invite their Facebook
account "Perwakin Harare".

 

Ok, that is all for part 1, time to go back to the apartment and prepare
some meal for Ifthar.

Zimbabwe, July 19th, 2014.
