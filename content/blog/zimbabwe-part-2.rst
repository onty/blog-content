So, I always put in my pray during Ramadhan, hoping that I can spend the
Ied Al Fitr celebration together with my family, but it turns out that
Allah gave me 'another' new family here in Zimbabwe :). Yes, I spend Ied
Al Fitr here with the big family of Indonesian citizens ( well, not that
big, only 40 people here including the kids ... ). The preparation day
started with making and cooking Ketupat lebaran together..after searched
in youtube, I finally created my very first Ketupat :D

Feels like home with the family. We close the day with ifthaar together
at the embassy office. After isya' in Masjid Al-Abbas on Boeing street,
we got confirmation that the moon has been seen on South Africa, that
means it should be visible in Harare too, so the next day will be the
1st of Syawal.

 

 

 

 

 

Ied prayer started around 8.15. We went to Arcadia mosque, where we met
most of Indonesian people there. I went together within the same car
with the embassy staff. Here's our selfie picture from inside the car :)

After Ied pray, everybody gathered around outside the mosque. They
provided some snacks and drinks for free for everybody in the mosque.
It's time for halal bihalal. I even met some Indonesian people I haven't
met before, Dr Widi and his family. They drove from Bulawayo directly to
Harare specially to celebrate the Ied al Fitr together with Indonesian
people in Harare :).

And that day continued as usual, since it's Monday. No official holiday
for me :). It's different with in Indonesia, it's like nothing big going
on that day, it's just normal day, business as usual. That is 1 major
difference in celebrating Ied Al Fitr far away from home.

Now, it's time to go back to Jakarta, and celebrate the Ied Al Fitr
together with my family. Happy belated Ied Al Fitr to all Muslims in the
world :)
