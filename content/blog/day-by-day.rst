They will always become our light. Why ? So many things in our life has
changed since they're here. Yep, from the first day they born, until
now, and hopefully forever. Here's our favorite pic from them :

Achi is now 2 years and 11 months old, and Izza is 8 months. Since
they're just a kid, sometimes they fight each other. This reminds us a
lot to our childhood, so we can understand how they behave. How each
other fight for more attention from their mom, how each other takes away
any stuff from others, ah..now we not only understand how difficult to
be a parent, and also how difficult to react wise in every cases :)
We will always remember the day when Achi stops to drink ASI from
Bunda. Here's what she said that day :
"*Achi sekarang dah gede, gak boleh mimik bun lagi, buat adek izza
aja*\ ". First 2 or 3 days, she can only see her sister drinks happily
from her Mom, with plain eyes. We know, she's trying soo hard to accept
it and get use to it. And finally, she made it. Now, Achi only request
for plain water before she go to sleep. We try to make everybody in this
family learn, about how important to share with others. It's difficult,
we know it, and yet-nobody's perfect, but still, this is a great lesson
for all of us.
And Izza, she's now able to sit by herself. She's become more active
than before ( well, she fell twice from our bed :D ) She always shows
her enthusiastic while seeing her older sister do everything. And just
like Achi, we will never forget her smile :) .

Dear Achiza, we hope so much to you. You force us to be a better person,
better parents, everyday, and always. Love u.. :)
