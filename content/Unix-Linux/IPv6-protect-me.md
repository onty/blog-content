So, I got IPv6 running in the house, now every device at home is routable from internet, which is ... 10% good and around 90% BAD.
Why ? You know why. Without any decent protection, anyone with just enough knowledge on how internet works ( by that I mean how to search in Google) can break in to my network and take (or leave) something important and nasty, right ?
Here comes *firewall* into play. As always, I started with googling around on how to protect my self from the big bad internet, specifically those relates to IPv6. I refer to the following URL :
