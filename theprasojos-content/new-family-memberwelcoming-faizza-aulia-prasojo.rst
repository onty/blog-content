21 February, right about 22.30 pm, our beloved 2nd daughter has born in
this world. It was one of the happiest moment on this family's life
journey and history. Yep, after 4 hours struggling, fighting the pain,
my wife finally gave birth-normally, with only little glitch at the
first. But Alhamdulillah, we can passed it all with the guidance from
Allah SWT :) Here's the picture of my wife before she gave birth, while
waiting on surgery room, look how tough she is during the process :) I'm
really really proud of her :)

And suddenly Achy come in and wanted to hug and kiss her little brother,
"Hai adek, welcome to this world, Mbak Achy will always love youuu :)",
yes Achy, you're right, we all love Faizza. Dear my little daughter,
welcome aboard, we've been waiting so long for you to finally born in
this world...
