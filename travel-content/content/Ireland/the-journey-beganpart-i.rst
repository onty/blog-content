It's 11 March 2007, when Grandpa and Grandma with auntie Pipot arrived
on Bukittinggi for my marriage. It's 3 days before our marriage day.
Before that, Grandma already read a lot about Bukittingi, including it's
famous Nasi kapau. They just can't wait to try it. Arrived on
Minangkabau International Airport, picked up by Mas Didiek and Mbak
Reni. Bukittinggi city is a very cold and fresh city. They spent 3-5
hours for transit and plane flight from Surabaya to Padang. Their
journey then continued about 3 hours (well, that includes lunch at Sate
Mak Syukur in Padang Panjang :D). Finally they arrived at Bukittinggi.

At 12 March, Grandma and Grandpa want to take a trip around Bukittinggi.
Here's their picture :

Yep, it's quite fun trip. Grandma and Grandpa never been this far from
home until their son married :D After few hours round trip, we finally
back home.

That's the end of Part I. Mommy will continue the story, daddy is sleepy
right now :D
