It's good to have your laptop travels with you. Like this, in airport, we dont have to be boring while we wait for the plane. Fast connection, provided by PCCW, one of Hongkong's telco operator. Thankyou PCCW.

First, open YM! messenger, and then open up my office mail....

Tadaaa, next assignment, 1. MiTV Malaysia on Monday..(WTF!) 2. STC Saudi Telecom, is this for real ????

Ok, the plane is boarding, we should get to the plane...
BTW, the picture from our journey will be uploaded soon. For yesterday's photo, you can see it here :
