Eventually, we're lucky. My friend's passport were found. So, yesterday, after finishing the training, we go to the airport to get the passport back.We ride MTR train from Admiralty station to Hongkong central station. After that we changed to Airport Express train.It only took 30 minutes from downtown hongkong to reach airport.That fast ? yep.

Ok, the instructor are coming, the training will be start any minutes, I'll stop the blogging and continue later...
